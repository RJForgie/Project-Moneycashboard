# MoneyCashboard

Project completed as part of CodeClan 16 week intensive Software Development bootcamp.

Budgeting web app that allows the user to track and analyse spending.

Built using Ruby, Sinatra, SQl and HTML/CSS.

## Brief

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money. You have decided to make a budgeting app to help you see where all of your money is being spent.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include a merchant name, e.g. Tesco, and a value ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'food', 'clothes'). Your app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.

MVP:

Create new transactions
Display a list of all transactions
Display total amount spent
Display total amount spent by tag
Possible Extensions:

CRUD actions for the transactions
Show a warning when the total expenditure is over budget (set a hard coded budget first)
Add a date to the transactions and view total spending by month
Any other ideas you might come up with
